<p>What is your most memorable experience in life?  Most likely it was a highly emotional event.  According to Cahill et al., the more emotionally impacting an experience is, the better it is remembered; this phenomenon is often referred to as memory enhancement (295).  The short story, “Unnecessary Things” by Tatyana Tolstaya (August 9, 2017) reveals internal conflict as the speaker considers herself as unnecessary.  This depiction is painted using evidence of emotionless solitude, fear of attachment, and abandonment.  By removing emotional items and attachment from the speaker’s surroundings, she was effectively trying to forget elements of her past.  Understanding the speaker’s relationship to her past fosters greater understanding of my own past.</p>
<p>The degree of separation the speaker choses to forego to minimize her emotional connection to her past is nearly unfathomable.  She lives alone and furnished her apartment with items that had previously belonged to other people; however, all of the pragmatic and manipulative meaning of the items has evaporated.  The speaker was so successful at eliminating items of comfort that she doesn’t even associate her own home as being hers.  At one point, she describes her apartment, “Everything there was insultingly new – that is, unfamiliar and alien” (Tolstaya).  The speakers emotional past is briefly described when she makes a correlation to her old teddy bear, “eighteen months old, not able to talk yet, sweet-smelling like oatmeal and applesauce, his face puffy from crying, lost but found, waiting for you all these decades” (Tolstaya). The speaker is referencing an emotionally chaotic event, in her early childhood where she felt lost and was sad.  At a time when babies are supposed to be happy, she was in pain and sadness for decades.  It’s strange how our past can subconsciously be interwoven into small knick-knacks or furniture, as if riddled with the memories of whatever was going on when the item was acquired.  This is why the speaker choses to surround herself with items that have no emotional connection to her past and won’t cause flashbulb episodic memories.  She is using out of sight, out of mind to protect herself from a traumatic past but repression is just a band-aid we use in hopes to forget something bad.  We need to come to grips with our experiences to avoid the pain of future haunting.</p>
<p>The speaker sketches a framework for fear of attachment throughout the short story.  At one point the speaker found an old teddy bear from her childhood and brought it home even though she knew the bear didn’t fit in with her lifestyle of “unnecessary things”.  The bear sparks love and emotion that the speaker hasn’t experienced in a long time.  The speaker uses the bear as a simile to a mother and child when she is reunited with the old cherished toy; she even shed tears when she found him.  That night, while sleeping with the bear, the speaker awoke and came to a realization that her attachment to the bear is a metaphor of her self-worth.  She states, “No, I thought, this cannot continue” (Tolstaya) and goes on to describe attachment in a negative light using the short story by William Faulkner, “A Rose for Emily.”  This is the pinnacle of internal conflict in the story where the speaker has gone through life with a belief that she is an “unnecessary thing” not worthy of attachment, but the feelings that she experiences through this bear cause her to question her own beliefs.  Emotions can be difficult to navigate, especially after being suppressed for long periods of time.  Eventually, when we allow subdued emotions to surface, they can cause pain which is one of the reasons why the speaker has such a strong fear of attachment.  The speaker lowers her guard to fear of attachment and in return struggles to understand her own value.</p>
<p>The speaker’s difficult past is rooted to a paradigm of abandonment that occurs again at the end of the story.  The speaker sets the bear on her bed and leaves on a trip; when she returns the bear is gone.  “In the morning, I left for Moscow.  And when I came back, a month later, the bear was gone.  He wasn’t on the bed, or under it; he wasn’t in any of the closets or in the crawlspace.  He was nowhere to be found.  Nowhere” (Tolstaya).  She deliberately looks for the bear to no resolve and finds herself abandoned solidifying her feeling as though she is unnecessary.  Sometimes when there is no clear path to why an event unfolded the way it did, we tend to place blame upon ourselves; this especially occurs if there is no one that holds responsibility.  As adults, we need to recognize this behavior and learn from these events to prevent them in the future, and not attack our own self-worth.  Understanding the abandonment from our past allows us to move forward without fear.</p>
<p>When I found out my ex-wife committed adultery in March 2008 I went through a period of isolation and emotional separation.  I turned away from friends and family.  My three-bedroom home became a storage unit for clothes with a shower.  After work I immediately drove down the road to Mohegan Sun Casino and drank my emotions away while playing black jack, Texas hold-em’, or craps.  I drowned myself in the sweat but acidic nectar of the agave plant as I drank each four-ounce glass of Don Julio neat.  The casino was littered with feelings of regret and rage, feelings I was all too familiar with.  The casino lifestyle was one hundred eighty degrees out of phase with everything I stood for, and yet it was the lifestyle I chose in order to forget the painful past that awaited me behind a lock I no longer had a key for.  My unfaithful wife was out of sight, out of mind; at least for the night. </p>
<p>As a child, I never knew my father, but I knew of him.  I knew the horrific stories of abuse, the scars and missing teeth, and anger towards me because every time my mother looked at me she saw him.  As step fathers came and went, I stopped calling them dad and started calling them by their first name.  Eventually, I stopped calling them anything at all and just retreated to my room when a “visitor” would come to stay for a few weeks or months.  I transitioned from someone looking for attachment to someone who distanced themselves from attachment.  It was easier emotionally when my potential new father would leave for good, just as my real father had done years before.  This fear of attachment grew into other areas of my life: personal belongings, friends, and girlfriends.  I didn’t allow anyone or anything to penetrate the superficial layer of intimacy.  However, unlike the speaker, I never questioned my self-worth.  Even today, I am extremely close to my immediate family and everyone else is simply an acquaintance that may leave at a moment’s notice; a protective mechanism stemming from a past of disappointment.</p>
<p>My earliest recollection of abandonment was within weeks of my little brother, Michael, drowning at twenty months old.  My mother handled the situation by ingesting a bottle of sleeping pills.  My last time seeing her as a toddler was holding the hand of my five-year-old sister, lying in a hospital bed, submissive to her self-induced comma.  Three years later, I was allowed to talk to my mother again, but the damage of abandonment had been done.  Our psychological development and analysis improve in stages.  As children, we tend to think the world revolves around us and we search for answers to problems within; blaming ourselves for someone else’s choices.  As young adults, we identify selfish people but still often fail to see their true depths of callous behavior.  As adults, we realize selfish people only truly love themselves and either accept or deny them.  Unlike the speaker, I know I am not to blame for abandonment, but it took a long time to understand that.</p>
<p>Analyzing other people’s past improves our ability to reflect and learn more about ourselves using our own past.  Additionally, experiences are often shared by others, to some extent, and learning more about how each of us react to situations allows for self-improvement.  Sometimes we rely on repression or another coping mechanism to delay dealing with a traumatic event to allow ourselves to stabilize.  Methods to cope can be identified as positive or negative and include separating ourselves from flashbulb memories, questioning our own beliefs, and safely placing blame for a situation.  It is important that we recognize our actions and eventual come to resolution with the situation in a healthy way.  How well do you know yourself?</p>
